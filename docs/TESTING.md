## Student flow
- [ ] Register (role assigned as "student" automatically, no selector shown)
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Browse internships, apply to one
- [ ] Try applying to the same internship again → expect 409 "already applied"

## Staff flow
- [ ] Login with a staff account created directly in MongoDB (no public registration)

- [ ] View applications, change a status, confirm the student receives a notification
- [ ] Post an announcement, confirm every student gets a notification
- [ ] View a student's profile and resume link

## Authorization checks (critical)
